# TheWorstCalculatorInTheWorld
It is exactly what the title says. A CLI calculator where the only probable use I can see of this is a really crappy computer running DOS or something.

# What can it do?
Well, it can do a lot of things like:

<ul>
  <li>Calculate Compound Intrest</li>
  <li>Calculate Retirement stuff</li>
  <li>Basic Arithmetic (to some extent)</li>
  <li>Graphical Representation (COMING SOON!!!)</li>
</ul>

# Why?
Why not?
